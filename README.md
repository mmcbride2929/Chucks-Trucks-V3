# Chucks-Trucks-V3
The Chucks-Trucks website showcases a fictional truck dealership. It features a homepage presenting ongoing sales, customer reviews, and details about Chuck's latest offers. Users can browse the available inventory, sort vehicles, and submit their budget and down payment for loan approval.

The project follows the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and incorporates Chakra UI for its styling. Notably, the website has been developed three times, with each iteration introducing new technologies. V1 was simply a React front end, and used a json file to store all vehicles. In V2 I built a Node.js backend & used axios to fetch the data from it. V3 mostly made logic improvements, and had a complete UI redesign.
